Surveying is the technique by which we determine the relative position of different features on the surface, above the surface or below the surface of the earth. As per the American Congress on Surveying and Mapping (ACSM), It is the science & arts of making all important measurements to determine the relative positions of points or physical and cultural details above, on, or below the surface of the Earth. To construct or modify them in a usable form, or to
establish the positions of points in details.This method of surveying also includes the method of establishing points by pre-defined angle and linear measurements. From the Sections, plans and Maps drawn by surveying, volume and the area of a some plot or site can be calculated so easily. A map always shows
the horizontal projections of the place or site surveyed and not theactual area. But the vertical distance can be shown more exactly by sketching the sections.During the surveying, the professionals (Engineers) use various tools or devices to do their job successfully & precisely, such as total stations, compass, radio communicators, GPS receivers, 3D scanners, digital levels, dumpy level & surveying software etc. The knowledge & Skills of surveying is helpful in many phases of engineering. Surveying is of great importance in any engineering projects. Examples of some of the basic importance of Surveying is
mentioned below.The first and for most necessity in surveying is to prepare a plan and the section of an areas that are to be covered in the project. From
these prepared maps & sections the best possible alignment, possible earthwork and other necessary details depending upon the nature of the project can be evaluated or calculated.

The planning and designing of all Civil Engineering projects such as
railways, highways, tunneling,dams, reservoirs, waterworks, sewerage
works, airfields, and massive buildings, etc. are based upon surveying
measurements.
During the process of execution of the project of any magnitude is
constructed along the lines and points established by surveying.
The processes like the measurement of land and the fixation of its
boundaries cannot be done without the surveying process.
The feasibility of the engineering projects such as economics and
engineering feasibilities of a project cannot be properly understood
or analyzed without undertaking a survey work.
Surveying is used to prepare a topographic map of a land surface of
the earth.
